      <description>After almost seven years using Wordpress and Blogger as my main blogging services, I have decided to change my mind, make a step forward and install a simple web/blog with a great frontend and without a complex database and their vulnerabilities. Furthermore, I do not like the feeling of Wordpress owning the content of my blog because it is hosted there.
Having a look at the possibilities I decided to try Jekyll on GitHub Pages.</description>

      <description>Github is undoubtedly one of the largest webpages when it comes to sharing work with the community. Also, Github allows us to work as a team with the Git version control tools and a nice frontend.
What is the best way to promote the use of this kind of tools among the student? I don&amp;rsquo;t know about your answer, but Github thinks that offering a &amp;ldquo;starter pack&amp;rdquo; is one of the best ways: The GitHub Student Developer Pack.</description>
